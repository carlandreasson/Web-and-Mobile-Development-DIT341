## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

How many times have we tried to find ourselves a table on a busy night but impossible to find anywhere to sit and enjoy a refreshing beverage.

This is soon over thanks to SEATR.
Our system allows restaurant and café owners to make their available tables visible to any owner of our app.

The product will function as a short term reservation system for restaurant goers. Restaurants can update information about the number of empty seats and tables they have available during the course of a busy day. Restaurant goers can view the information about restaurants’ available seatings and make short term reservations that will only be valid within the next thirty minutes. Once a restaurant owner has reserved seats the seats in question will not be visible by other restaurant goers anymore. The restaurant will get notified of the reserved seats and reserve them until the restaurant goer arrives at the restaurant. If the restaurant goers do not show up at the restaurant within thirty minutes the reservation will be off and the seats will show up as available again. Restaurants must share their number of available tables and each table must have their available seats. Restaurant goers must share the number of people in a group.

### Pages

* Home:
  Login as a professional or a customer if login

* Restaurant page:
When a customer select a restaurant, they are redirected to the page containing all information about that restaurant and the possibility to book a    table

* Booking page: 
  Allows a customer to book a page (and give information about when and how many people are going to sit).

* Management page for the restaurants/bar/café: 
  This page, if logged in as a restaurant, allows professionals to register their available tables on the app and confirm incoming bookings.
